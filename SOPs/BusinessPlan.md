# II. OPPORTUNITY

### PROBLEM
Middle Tennessee’s humidity and usage patterns cause recurring algae/mildew growth on siding and roofs, oil and rust stains on concrete, and oxidation on gutters.  
DIY methods risk surface damage and lack consistency; existing providers often have reliability and documentation issues.

### SOLUTION
A&W implements a **soft-wash, standards-based process** including:

- Pre-inspection and masking  
- Plant protection  
- Correct chemistry and pressure selection  
- Full rinse and post-job photo documentation  
- SMS/email reminders and digital quotes via Stripe integration  
- 7-day workmanship warranty  

### BENEFIT TO CUSTOMERS
- Digital booking and notifications  
- Safer methods  
- Before/after documentation  
- Maintenance plans for recurring care  
- Transparent pricing  
- Predictable results and reliability  

### MARKET CONDITIONS
Consistent rainfall and HOA regulations create recurring demand for exterior cleaning.  
Customers prefer insured, professional, digitally managed vendors — a niche A&W fills locally.

# III. INDUSTRY

### COMPETITORS
The market includes:
1. **Single-operator cleaners** — Underpriced, minimal insurance, limited professionalism.  
2. **Franchise/multi-crew providers** — Expensive, less flexible for small jobs.  
3. **General contractors/landscapers** — Offer pressure washing as an add-on with poor technique.  

**A&W Differentiators:**
- Professionalism and transparent communication  
- Digital booking and automated reminders  
- Documented results and insured operations  
- Soft-wash specialization  
- Transition plan from price-based to reputation-based competition  

A&W aims to lead in **digital efficiency, insured operations, and consistent results** in the tri-county area.
