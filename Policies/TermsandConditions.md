##  Terms & Conditions

*Last updated: **November 5, 2025***
*Applies to: **awpressurewashing.pages.dev** and all quotes, invoices, work orders, and services provided by **A & W Pressure Washing & Cleaning** (“A&W,” “we,” “us,” “our”).*

> **Quick summary (not a substitute for the full terms):** You authorize us to clean specified surfaces using industry-standard methods. You agree to prepare the site (move items, close windows, etc.), provide safe access, and pay as agreed. We warrant workmanship, not the natural limitations of aged/oxidized or previously damaged materials. Some risks are inherent (e.g., water intrusion, plant stress). Please read all sections before approving service.

## 1) Parties & Acceptance

1.1 **Parties.** These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) are a binding agreement between **A & W Pressure Washing & Cleaning** and the “Client” (property owner or authorized agent).
1.2 **Acceptance.** Client accepts these Terms by: (a) signing a quote/work order; (b) paying a deposit or invoice; (c) responding “approve/yes” in writing; or (d) permitting work to begin.
1.3 **Entire Agreement.** These Terms plus our written Quote/Scope of Work (“SOW”), any Change Orders, and our Privacy Policy form the entire agreement and supersede prior communications. Handwritten changes are not valid unless countersigned by A&W.

## 2) Scope of Services

2.1 **Services.** Exterior cleaning including, but not limited to: house/building wash (soft wash), roof treatment (soft wash), concrete and flatwork cleaning, patios/decks/fences, gutters (face brightening &/or interior debris removal if listed), awnings, signage, drive-thru/parking lots, trash pads/compactors, playgrounds, and sanitation of specified surfaces.
2.2 **Methods.** We may use **soft-wash**, low/medium/high-pressure surface cleaning, detergents (e.g., surfactants, degreasers), and specialty chemistry (e.g., sodium hypochlorite for organic growth; oxalic/acidic/rust removers where specified).
2.3 **Exclusions.** Unless explicitly listed in the SOW: stain/seal, painting, mortar/caulk repair, window detailing, efflorescence removal, oxidation removal, graffiti removal, heavy oil/rust remediation, and post-construction cleanup are excluded.
2.4 **Results.** Cleaning removes organic growth and typical soiling; **permanent stains**, artillery fungus, battery/rust burns, deep oil, tannins, and oxidation are often **not fully correctable** without add-on services.

## 3) Scheduling, Access & Site Preparation

3.1 **Scheduling.** Dates are estimates and weather-dependent. We may adjust for rain, lightning, wind, freezing temps, or unsafe conditions without liability.
3.2 **Access.** Client must provide clear, safe access to water spigots, electrical outlets (if required), gates, and service areas. Dogs/pets must be secured away from work zones.
3.3 **Preparation Checklist (Client Responsibility).**

* Close/lock **all windows/doors**; ensure weather-stripping is intact.
* Move vehicles **off** cleaning zones/overspray areas.
* Remove or cover: cushions, mats, fabrics, décor, grill covers, fragile items, potted plants directly against walls, and electronics.
* Identify leaks, defective gutters, compromised seals, and sensitive plants/materials.
* Provide disclosure of known hazards (loose siding, failing stucco, oxidized paint, damaged concrete/epoxy, low-quality window seals, etc.).
  3.4 **Trip/Standby Fees.** If access/preparation prevents work, a **$65 trip/standby** fee or **20% of job minimum** (whichever is greater) may apply.

## 4) Water, Utilities & Environmental Practices

4.1 **Water Supply.** Client authorizes use of on-site water and ensures spigots are functional. If water is unavailable, additional fees may apply for tanked water if offered.
4.2 **Runoff & BMPs.** We follow reasonable **Best Management Practices (BMPs)** to limit overspray and direct runoff. Client understands normal wash water may contact soil/landscaping and exterior drains.
4.3 **Plants/Landscaping.** We pre-wet/rinse adjacent plants when using active solutions. **Despite precautions, temporary plant stress or spotting can occur.** Client may pre-water and request plant coverings for sensitive species where safe.

---

## 5) Surface & Material Risks (Acknowledgment)

5.1 **Oxidation & Tiger-Striping.** Aged vinyl/aluminum or oxidized paints can streak (“tiger-striping”) when washed. Full oxidation removal is **not** standard cleaning and can reveal uneven fade.
5.2 **Weep Holes/Window Seals.** Brick/vinyl weep holes may drain discoloration after washing; older window seals may allow minor intrusion or spotting; we are not responsible for pre-existing seal failures.
5.3 **Wood.** Pressure can raise grain (“furring”); soft-wash minimizes risk but weathered wood may shed fibers or fuzz.
5.4 **Concrete/Flatwork.** “Shadowing” or “wand marks” can appear on heavily soiled or unevenly cured slabs. Oil/rust/fertilizer burns may remain.
5.5 **Roofing.** **Soft-wash only** (no high pressure). Granule loss and shingle fragility are age-related; treatments kill growth but heavy staining may take weeks to lighten with rain/UV.
5.6 **Delicate/Compromised Materials.** Loose mortar, failing stucco/render, oxidized paint, brittle screens, dry-rotted trims, and degraded sealants can fail under normal rinsing.

*Client acknowledges these inherent risks and authorizes industry-standard methods appropriate to the SOW.*

## 6) Property Authorization & Permits

6.1 **Authority.** Client warrants they are the owner or have authority to approve work.
6.2 **HOA/Permits.** Client is responsible for HOA approvals and any required permits unless otherwise stated in the SOW.

---

## 7) Estimates, Pricing & Changes

7.1 **Estimates.** Written estimates are valid for **30 days** unless noted. Pricing assumes disclosed conditions and standard soil levels.
7.2 **Change Orders.** Hidden conditions, extra areas, or specialty stain removal require **written** approval and may adjust price/time.
7.3 **Minimum Charge.** A minimum service charge may apply and will be shown on the estimate/invoice.

---

## 8) Deposits, Payment & Fees

8.1 **Deposit.** We may require up to **30%** to schedule. Deposits are credited to the final invoice.
8.2 **Payment Due.** **Upon completion** unless otherwise agreed in writing. For commercial accounts with terms, net days run from invoice date.
8.3 **Methods.** Cash; card via **Stripe**; **Cash App**; other approved methods on invoice.
8.4 **Late/Collection.** Balances over **7 days** past due accrue **1.5% per month** (18% APR) or the maximum allowed by law, plus collection costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

11.3 **Indirect Damages.** We are **not** liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (including lost profits or use).
11.4 **Cap on Liability.** To the fullest extent allowed by law, our total aggregate liability for claims arising from a job is limited to the **amount you paid for that job** in the **preceding 6 months**.
